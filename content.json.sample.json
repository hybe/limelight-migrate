    "description":"These days you can't turn on your phone or TV without hearing about the flow of refugees forced to flee their home countries. Just like any challenge facing the society, there are startups out there working hard to address their needs. HYBE met up with an entrepreneur that decided to make a difference and help the people in need with little bit of technology and the power of the crowd."
